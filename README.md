Remove and replace datatypes using replace function, groupby data into useful pivot table. Also we learned about using describe function to easily bring out std , mean , min and etc. In this challenge we discoverd Montgomery High School has the most student participate in this test, Charter school type has high average math score vs the average Public school students
